My name is Stephen Sengebush, and I am an illustrator, web designer, and comic-book creator.

I live in Amherst Massachusetts

This is intended to serve as an easy, sortable portfolio page, and a platform for experimentation in hosting and displaying webcomics.

If you want to inquire regarding original art or commissions, you can contact me at steve@sengebush.com
